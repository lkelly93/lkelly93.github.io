### Coding Challenges.

- [Cell Compete](https://github.com/lkelly93/CellCompete)

  My solution to the Cell Compete Challenge. I thought it would be interesting to attack it with a linked list implemenation.
- [Morse Code](https://github.com/lkelly93/MorseCode)

  Fun prompt from my Computer Science Club, to translate text to Morse Code and back.
- [Esitmate Pi](https://github.com/lkelly93/estimate-pi)

  A super simple yet challenging challange. Estimate the value of pi using only your random number generator and arithmetic operations. 
- [Rotate Image](https://github.com/lkelly93/rotateimage)

  Rotate a given two dimensional array by 90 degrees. I thought this would be a fun assignment to appproach with some linear algebra so I wrote this solution.
