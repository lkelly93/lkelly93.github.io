### Coding Challenges.

- [Cell Compete(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/CellCompete)

  My solution to the Cell Compete Challenge. I thought it would be interesting to attack it with a linked list implementation.
- [Morse Code(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/MorseCode)

  Fun prompt from my Computer Science Club, to translate text to Morse Code and back.
- [Esitmate Pi(Go)](https://github.com/lkelly93/estimate-pi)

  A super simple yet challenging challenge. Estimate the value of pi using only your random number generator and arithmetic operations. 
- [Rotate Image(Go)](https://github.com/lkelly93/rotateimage)

  Rotate a given two-dimensional array by 90 degrees. I thought this would be a fun assignment to approach  with some linear algebra, so I wrote this solution.

### Personal Projects
- [Sudoku Solver(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/Sudoku-Solver)

  Thought this would be an interesting, problem to solve. I used a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku.
- [Huffman Coding Tree(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/HuffmanCoding)

  A proof of concept for a Huffman Coding Tree. I was able to get an average of 4.6 bits per character, almost half the standard 8 bits per character of ASCII
