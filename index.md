### Coding Challenges.

- [Cell Compete(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/CellCompete)

  My solution to the Cell Compete Challenge. I thought it would be interesting to attack it with a linked list implementation.
- [Morse Code(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/MorseCode)

  Fun prompt from my Computer Science Club, to translate text to Morse Code and back.
- [Estimate Pi(Go)](https://github.com/lkelly93/estimate-pi)

  A super simple yet challenging challenge. Estimate the value of pi using only your random number generator and arithmetic operations. 
- [Rotate Image(Go)](https://github.com/lkelly93/rotateimage)

  Rotate a given two-dimensional array by 90 degrees. I thought this would be a fun assignment to approach  with some linear algebra, so I wrote this solution.

### Personal Projects
- [Hacks'20 Submission](https://github.com/imranmaj/hack-20-discord-bot)

  This was my team's submission for Hacks'20 a hackathon hosted at UW.  It is a discord bot that allows you to write code in discord and it will run it for you. I am the one who came up with the idea and formed the team. My role specifically on the team was to setup our bot's running environment and I also designed and wrote the code that took the written code, grabbed it, ran it, and then returned the result.
  
- [Scheduler](https://github.com/lkelly93/scheduler)
 
  After getting a taste for it in my hackathon I thought that creating a program that runs other peopleâ€™s code was a fun challenge. So, this is going to be part of my backend that will receive code from some external controller, schedule it to be run, run it, and then return the results. It is still in development but will eventually be part of a bigger cog. I also wrote this while learning Go, which was incredibly fun!
  
- [Executable](https://github.com/lkelly93/executable)
  
  A large portion of the Scheduler package is the ability to run foriegn code "safely". This package will execute foreign code in a manually built container to prevent the program from having access to the machine it is running on. The Scheduler package will eventually be refactored to use this repo instead of the current executable package that exists in that repo.
  
- [Sudoku Solver(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/Sudoku-Solver)

  Thought this would be an interesting, problem to solve. I used a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku.
- [Huffman Coding Tree(Java)](https://github.com/lkelly93/HuffmanCoding)

  A proof of concept for a Huffman Coding Tree. I was able to get an average of 4.6 bits per character, almost half the standard 8 bits per character of ASCII
